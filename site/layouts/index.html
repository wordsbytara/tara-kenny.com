            Hello! Iâ€™m Tara Kenny, a freelance arts and culture writer based in
            Naarm/Melbourne. I'm a [television critic for *The
            Monthly*](https://www.themonthly.com.au/author/tara-kenny) and also
            write about everything from [trendy NYC chess
            clubs](https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/sep/13/new-york-gen-z-chess-clubs),
            to [tough love, female self-help
            gurus](https://www.dazeddigital.com/life-culture/article/59961/1/andrew-tate-for-girls-the-new-wave-of-woman-self-help-gurus),
            the [millennial aesthetics of psychedelic
            spaces](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uMv5RREgYcT-9arhD_zrHaDhM-HZiCYe/view)
            and [Schapelle Corby]
            (https://www.liminalmag.com/liminal-review-of-books/our-schapelle),
            for publications including
            <i
              >Interview, The Guardian, Brooklyn Magazine, i-D, Dazed, V, Daily
              Dot, Dirt, Outland, Paper, Gossamer, The Saturday Paper, The Age,
              The Sydney Morning Herald, Frankie</i
            >
            and numerous others. High brow analysis of low brow culture and how
            women use and are portrayed in the media are recurring fixations in
            my work.
