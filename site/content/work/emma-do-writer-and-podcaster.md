_Emma Do is a Melbourne-based freelance writer with a focus on fashion and culture, and the sometimes sticky, always compelling places they intersect. She is the co-founder of Smart Casual podcast. Emma has been published in Broadsheet, i-D, VICE and Complex._

_Emma spoke to Tara about writing fashion through a critical lens, co-founding the Smart Casual Podcast, and using creative outlets to avoid being forced to become an accountant._

**Funnily enough, I’ve actually interviewed you twice before. The first time was when we first met and I interviewed you about Pocketto, the glossy fashion magazine you made when you were a teenager! Pocketto is such an impressive early project. 

I love that we eventually became friends in the years after the first time you interviewed me. Pocketto started at some point during my years as a wee fashion blogger in my teens. I’ve always been obsessed with magazines but I wanted a place where deserving local talent in fashion and illustration could be spotlighted, so I made that happen through Pocketto. I was also scared I’d grow up and forced to be an accountant if I didn’t make some sort of creative dream happen from an early age. Pocketto eventually became a website that published writing, fashion photos and illustrations by emerging talents. In the final years of its life we raised money to take it into print. Being 17 and publishing and distributing a printed magazine was truly anxiety-inducing, but I am eternally grateful for all the people who contributed their energies and believed in us.

Your work remains focused on fashion, writing and publishing in various manifestations. Can you fill in the blanks about what you’ve been up to since?**

I went on to study Journalism at university with the vague goal of ending up writing for magazines. Somewhere along the way I took a liking to news journalism and went on to feel completely conflicted as to what kind of writing I wanted to do in the future – did I really have to pick? Turns out you can kind’ve do it all and more with web writing.

I don’t typify myself as a fashion writer, although I’ve written a fair amount about fashion in the last two years. It’s been great to have a steady beat to focus on and to carve out a little niche for myself covering Australian fashion—from indie, to high end and in-between. Elsewhere I’m experimenting with telling stories through audio and multimedia.
