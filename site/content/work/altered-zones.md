Calling for submissions to a digital zine exploring altered physical and psychic states and spaces, born from the altered zone of quarantine.

Think psychedelic states of consciousness, captivity (from government enforced isolation to big cats in Oklahoma), hypnosis, artificial environments (aquariums, shopping malls, casinos), Stockholm syndrome, psychosis, alien encounters, reality television, holotropic breathwork, and more.

Altered Zones welcomes pitches or completed writing, illustrations, video art, guided meditations, performance videos and any other experimental formats. **All contributors will be paid $50 for their piece and the final zine will be available for purchase online with all sales money donated to COVID-19 relief efforts. Please send submissions to wordsbytara@gmail.com by Monday May 1.**
