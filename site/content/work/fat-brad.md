**The Project**

_Fat Brad, The Cookbook_ is a definitive exploration into the on-screen eating habits of William Bradley “Brad” Pitt. Part fan fantasy, part filmic study, _Fat Brad_ meticulously reimagines the best scenes where Brad chomps. From Rusty’s carpark burger in _Ocean’s 11_ to Tyler’s questionable Seafood Bisque in _Fight Club_, no plate is left unturned. _Fat Brad_ is the first in a series of pop culture inspired cookbooks by Melbourne based collective Long Prawn. Books that feed fandom, fascinations and of course, your gut.

**My Role**

As co-editor and co-writer of Fat Brad, I co-wrote and co-edited the prologue and introductions for 17 recipes in collaboration with the Long Prawn team. 

_“Impeccable in every sense of the word; just when the wheels fell of this project, Tara was there to clarify and distill our words. 10/10”_ – Long Prawn
