_Welcome to the third episode of The Strumpet Diaries, a smutty illustrated comic written by Tara Kenny and illustrated by Madison Griffiths._

_We follow Betty, a small town girl with big city dreams, as she moves to New York, sniffs out her "authentic coven" at a women's only co-working space and is forced to make some tough decisions about her high school sweetheart Doug._
