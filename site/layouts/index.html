    <p>Hello! I’m Tara Kenny, an arts and culture writer based in Naarm/Melbourne.</p>

  <p>I write regular TV reviews for <em>The Monthly</em>, as well as criticism and reporting on pop culture, internet detritus, and IRL trends for various local and international publications. High-brow analysis of low-brow culture and dissecting media portrayals of women are my specialties.</p>

  <p>I’ve participated in readings, panel discussions and podcasts for the Melbourne Writers Festival, Asian American Writers’ Workshop, Backyard Stories, <em>Ladies of Leisure</em>, <em>The Paris End</em> and Schwartz Media. In 2024, I participated in the MIFF Critics Campus.</p>
