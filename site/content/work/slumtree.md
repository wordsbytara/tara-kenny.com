_Slumtree_ is an online interactive fiction narrative, created in collaboration by Tara Kenny and comic artist & illustrator Rachel Ang.

A modern take on _Goosebumps_, _Slumtree_ is a choose-your-own-adventure story about the highs and lows of life in share houses. Who hasn’t dreamed of hitting the jackpot with a rent free squat complete with running water, only to end up back on Mum and Dad’s couch?

Slumtree explores the space between dreams of an affordable, crumbling bohemian terrace in Carlton à la _Monkey Grip_ and the potential reality of sharing a room with a lecherous Irish backpacker in the Docklands for $250 a week.
