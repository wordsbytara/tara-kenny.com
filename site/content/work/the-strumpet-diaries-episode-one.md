_Welcome to The Strumpet Diaries, a smutty illustrated comic sure to fire up your loins and get your bratwursts throbbing, written by Tara Kenny and illustrated by Madison Griffiths._

_Our first comic follows Lakshmi, a woman with one eye on spiritual awakening and the other on what’s going on underneath a certain hot Buddhist monk’s robes. Find out whether Venerable Mahesh and Lakshmi are going straight to the hell realms for their lusty sins at the Root Chakra Retreat below…Om mane padme hottie!_
