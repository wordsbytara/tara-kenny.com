_Fat Brad The Cookbook_ is a definitive exploration into the on-screen eating habits of William Bradley “Brad” Pitt by [Long Prawn collective](https://www.longprawn.com/). Part fan fantasy, part filmic study, _Fat Brad_ meticulously reimagines the best scenes where Brad chomps. From Rusty’s carpark burger in _Ocean’s 11_ to Tyler’s questionable Seafood Bisque in _Fight Club_, no plate is left unturned.

I assisted in writing and editing the prologue and introductions for the recipes, in collaboration with the Long Prawn team. 

_“Impeccable in every sense of the word; just when the wheels fell of this project, Tara was there to clarify and distill our words. 10/10”_ – Long Prawn
