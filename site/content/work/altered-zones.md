[Altered Zones](https://gumroad.com/alteredzones) is a digital zine exploring altered physical and psychic states and spaces, born from the altered zone of quarantine. The zine was exhibited at the first ever virtual Tokyo Art Book Fair in November 2020.

Issue 001 is a smorgasbord of weird and wonderful morsels, including guided crying exercises, Maine lobster roll flavored vapes, an initiation into the capitalist death cult, a claustrophobic quar confessional, a day at a Queensland thoroughbred auction, a use at your own risk DIY social distancing frisbee, and much, much more.

Designed by Sam Hains and edited by Tara Kenny, with contributions from Alice Heyward, Camilla Padgitt-Coles, Charlie Freedman, Chengtao Yi, Drew Zeiba, Georgia Spanos, Joseph Gauci-Seddon, Kelly Mill, Long Prawn, Maddison Kitching, Marcelo Lavin, Oscar Schwartz, Tara Kenny, Sam Hains and Sharada Tolton.

100% of proceeds from the zine are split between the [Drug Policy Alliance](drugpolicy.org) and [Drug Policy Australia](drugpolicy.org.au), with donations made in memory of Harry Hains.
