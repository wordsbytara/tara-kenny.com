Calling for submissions to a digital zine exploring altered physical and psychic states and spaces, born from the altered zone of quarantine.

Think psychedelic states of consciousness, captivity (from government enforced isolation to big cats in Oklahoma), hypnosis, artificial environments (aquariums, shopping malls, casinos), Stockholm syndrome, psychosis, alien encounters, reality television, holotropic breathwork and more.

Altered Zones welcomes pitches of writing, illustrations, video art, guided meditations, performance videos and any other experimental formats â€“ the weirder the better! **All contributors will be paid $50 for their piece and the final zine will be available for purchase as a pdf with all sales money donated to COVID-19 relief. Please send pitches to wordsbytara@gmail.com by Monday May 1.**
