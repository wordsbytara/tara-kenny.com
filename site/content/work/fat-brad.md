**The Project**

*Fat Brad, The Cookbook* is a definitive exploration into the on-screen eating habits of William Bradley “Brad” Pitt. Part fan fantasy, part filmic study, *Fat Brad* meticulously reimagines the best scenes where Brad chomps. From Rusty’s carpark burger in *Ocean’s 11* to Tyler’s questionable Seafood Bisque in *Fight Club*, no plate is left unturned. *Fat Brad* is the first in a series of pop culture inspired cookbooks by Melbourne based collective Long Prawn. Books that feed fandom, fascinations and of course, your gut.

**My Role**

As co-editor and co-writer of Fat Brad, I co-wrote and co-edited the prologue and introductions for 17 recipes in collaboration with the Long Prawn team. 

*“Impeccable in every sense of the word; just when the wheels fell of this project, Tara was there to clarify and distill our words. 10/10”* – Long Prawn
